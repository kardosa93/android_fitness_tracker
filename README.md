Fitness Tracker for Android

Developing an application for an Android phone that utilizes the network capabilities of the platform. The app takes advantage of the ability to communicate with the outside world. Also, we could implement other technologies of the Android Mobile API, thereby increasing the efficiency of the use of the application. The key was to find the best combination of the different features. The main concept of my project was a multi-screen fitness tracker application, which stores the data recorded by the GPS-receiver in a database.

Technologies used: Android Studio with Java; Android SQLite Database
